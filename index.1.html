        <p class="lead mb-4">Throughout my career, I have held key positions in leading organizations, where I have consistently delivered exceptional results. My journey began at a cultural club in highschool called International Desi Connections, where I took on the officer position of Project Manager. As Project Manager, I oversaw the organization of the events our club hosted and managed the social media accounts, where I promoted our events and performances to the public. Over the years, I took on increasingly challenging roles, including Secretary for International Desi Connections. In my time as secretary, I co-led the club meetings, filled out RPOâ€™s, documented the information we covered in meetings, and helped manage the lower officer positions. 

<br><br>

        I later joined the Bollywood Fusion dance team at my highschool and became a Co-Captain of it. Through this role, I honed my leadership skills and communication skills by leading practices and organizing dance shows. I used my creative skills to create complex choreography for my team to perform at local dance competitions in the Bay Area. I gained interpersonal skills and patience through this experience. While organizing dance shows, I honed my problem solving skills, as there were many conflicts between performers, the production team, and the school staff. This experience made me a better leader and allowed me to work on showing empathy when necessary.
<br><br>

        As I continued to grow my professional experience, I participated in an internship at a network company called Ruckus Commscope, where I shadowed the head of HR. I organized company documents, which helped me hone my organizational skills. I also watched marketing presentations and participated in case studies relating to dilemmas in the workplace, which allowed me to develop my professional and public speaking skills. From this experience, I also gained an understanding of company workplace environments and the importance of professionalism in the professional environment. 
<br><br>
        My expertise in adaptability and leadership has been instrumental in my success. I am highly skilled in communication and problem-solving, which both have consistently led to improved productivity and efficiency. My strong analytical abilities, problem-solving skills, and empathy have enabled me to work through issues rooted from miscommunication between parties. I am a results-driven professional with a strong track record of success. My dedication, expertise, and ability to exceed expectations have consistently driven growth and innovation in my roles. I am passionate and committed to achieving excellence in every endeavor and determined to overcome any obstacles that I may face on the way. With a proven history of accomplishment and a commitment to ongoing learning, I am well-prepared to make valuable contributions to any organization or project. My ability to adapt to changing landscapes, my dedication to excellence, and my commitment to ongoing self-improvement makes me a valuable asset to any organization.
